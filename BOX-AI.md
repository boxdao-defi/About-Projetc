# About-Projetc
DeFi platform, for everyone who believes in decentralization as a best solution. Our platform solves problems in the DeFi space connected to payments, custody, minting, token locks and liquidity and fundraising.
BOX-AI: is the governance token of our DeFi Rewards Platform. The project will provide a decentralized investment option, so that investors always have control over their funds, 100% automated and instantaneous. A secure staking solution, farms, exchange and AI-powered trading technology coming soon so you can earn without having to trade.

BOX AI aims to develop better solutions and alternatives every day, always improving processes, to add to the cryptocurrency market. Based on a complete DeFi platform, we will trigger a series of changes in the way people see the decentralized world, taking our solutions to companies outside of this market, bringing them to the blockchain.
Thinking about the sustainability of our governance token ($BOX-AI) and the viability of holders to be trading without major adverse impact, we calculated a tax of 1% (buy/sell) on transactions. This tax will be enough for the development of the project, delivering solutions that we believe will have a direct impact on the token. The bigger the platform, the more users, the more the token grows and returns big gains to holders.
BOX AI came to be different, to do better, daring to create new products. The revolution begins when new solutions are created to meet new needs. Don’t miss the moment, let’s do much more.
